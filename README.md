# Contribution
Anyone who got interest with it can fork the repo and submit a pull request.

You can also write your thought in the **Issues**.

By the way, since there is no C# API Documentation about Godot namespace, you can also contribute it by switiching to the **API_Doc** branch ans submitting a pull request.

# Copyright
This repo doesn't include any assets (like models, textures, etc) from the original Unity Standard Assets.

The code from it was rewritten to make sure it's working on Godot Engine.

Everyone are free to use, modify the source code as long as give me the credit.

Anyways, happy programming!

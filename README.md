# Copyright
This repo doesn't include any assets (like models, textures, etc) from the original Unity Standard Assets.

The code from it was rewritten to make sure it's working on Godot Engine.

Everyone are free to use, modify the source code as long as give me the credit.

Anyways, happy programming!
